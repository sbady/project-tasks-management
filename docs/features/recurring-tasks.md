# Recurring Tasks


TaskNotes recurring tasks use RFC 5545 RRule strings with `DTSTART` support and dynamic next-occurrence scheduling. The model separates recurrence patterns from the next planned instance.

If you are new to recurring tasks in TaskNotes, think of the recurrence rule as the long-term plan and the `scheduled` field as the next concrete commitment. Most day-to-day editing affects `scheduled`, while recurrence editing changes the plan itself.

## Core Concepts

Recurring tasks operate on two independent levels:

1. **Recurring Pattern**: Defines when pattern instances appear (controlled by `DTSTART` in the recurrence rule)
2. **Next Occurrence**: The specific date/time when you plan to work on the next instance (controlled by the `scheduled` field)

This separation lets you reschedule the next occurrence without changing the pattern.

## Setting Up Recurring Tasks

In practice, setup is usually a two-step flow: choose a pattern, then check whether the next scheduled occurrence matches how you actually want to execute the next instance.

### Creating Recurrence Patterns

You can create recurring tasks through:

1. **Recurrence Context Menu** in task modals for presets or custom options
2. **Preset Options** such as daily, weekly, or monthly
3. **Custom Recurrence Modal** with date/time pickers and RRule configuration

### Required Components

Recurring tasks require:

- **Recurrence Rule**: RRule string with `DTSTART`
- **Scheduled Date**: Next occurrence date (independent from the pattern)

### DTSTART Integration

`DTSTART` is the anchor for pattern generation. It controls where the rule begins and, when time is included, the default time for future pattern instances.

- **Date-only**: `DTSTART:20250804;FREQ=DAILY`
- **Date and time**: `DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=DAILY`

## Recurring Task Due Date

When a recurring task is completed, `scheduled` advances to the next occurrence. By default, `due` does not change.

Enable `Maintain due date offset in recurring tasks` in **Settings → TaskNotes → Features → Recurring Tasks** to preserve due/scheduled spacing.

Example:

- Scheduled: `2025-01-01`
- Due: `2025-01-03`
- Recurrence: weekly

If the task advances to `scheduled: 2025-01-08`, the due date becomes `2025-01-10` when this setting is enabled.

This setting is most useful when due dates represent a fixed lead/lag relative to scheduled work (for example, "due two days after execution"). If due dates are independent deadlines, leaving the setting off is usually clearer.

## Recurrence Pattern Examples

```text
DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=DAILY
→ Daily at 9:00 AM, starting August 4, 2025

DTSTART:20250804T140000Z;FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR
→ Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 2:00 PM, starting August 4, 2025

DTSTART:20250815;FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15
→ 15th of each month (all-day), starting August 15, 2025

DTSTART:20250801T100000Z;FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=-1FR
→ Last Friday of each month at 10:00 AM, starting August 1, 2025
```

## Dynamic Scheduled Dates

The `scheduled` field automatically tracks the next uncompleted occurrence:

1. Initially set to the `DTSTART` date
2. Advances when occurrences are completed
3. Recalculates when the rule changes
4. Can be manually rescheduled independently

This behavior keeps recurring tasks practical in real planning: you can preserve a stable weekly/monthly pattern while still adapting the immediate next occurrence to calendar realities.

### Example Behavior

```yaml
# Initial state
recurrence: "DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=DAILY"
scheduled: "2025-08-04T09:00"
complete_instances: []

# After completing Aug 4
recurrence: "DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=DAILY"
scheduled: "2025-08-05T09:00"
complete_instances: ["2025-08-04"]

# After manually rescheduling next occurrence
recurrence: "DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=DAILY"
scheduled: "2025-08-05T14:30"
complete_instances: ["2025-08-04"]
```

## Calendar Drag and Drop

Calendar interactions follow the same model distinction: drag the concrete next item to reschedule execution, or drag a pattern instance to redefine the recurrence anchor.

Recurring tasks can show:

- **Next occurrence** (solid border): dragging updates only `scheduled`
- **Pattern instances** (dashed border): dragging updates `DTSTART` and future pattern instances

## Completion Tracking

Each occurrence can be completed independently (task cards, calendar menus, task edit modal completion calendar).

Completed instances are stored in:

```yaml
complete_instances: ["2025-08-04", "2025-08-06", "2025-08-08"]
```

When completion changes, `scheduled` updates to the next uncompleted instance.

This means completion history and next-action planning stay synchronized automatically, without manually advancing recurring tasks.

## Flexible Scheduling

TaskNotes intentionally allows off-pattern scheduling so recurring tasks can absorb real-world disruptions without rewriting the entire recurrence rule.

The next occurrence can be:

- Before `DTSTART`
- Outside the pattern day
- At a different time than pattern instances
- Far ahead while pattern continues unchanged

### Examples

```yaml
# Early start before DTSTART
recurrence: "DTSTART:20250810T090000Z;FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO"
scheduled: "2025-08-07T14:00"
```

```yaml
# Off-pattern next occurrence
recurrence: "DTSTART:20250804T090000Z;FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO"
scheduled: "2025-08-06T15:30"
```

## Timezone Handling

Recurring task logic uses a UTC anchor approach:

- Pattern generation uses UTC dates
- `DTSTART` dates are interpreted as UTC anchors
- Display adapts to local timezone
- Prevents common off-by-one date issues

In other words, calculations stay stable internally while display remains local, which avoids drift when traveling or sharing vaults across timezones.

## Backward Compatibility

Recurring behavior remains compatible with older task data, so upgrades do not require manual note rewrites.

- Legacy RRule strings without `DTSTART` continue to work using `scheduled` as anchor
- Legacy recurrence objects are converted to RRule format
- Existing tasks continue to function without migration steps
- Mixed formats are handled transparently
